So first we throw the ground meat on the grill. Then we hit it with the onions and peppers. After we hit it with the peppers and onions now we chop it up. After we chop it up now we hit it with the seasoning. Once the chop's ready now we hit it with the cheese. Once the cheese is ready now we put it on top of the bread. Once everything's ready now we hit it with the lettuce and tomatoes. Once everythings ready now we put it on top of the paper. Nooooow we wraaaap it uuuup. Then the resuuuult duuude. OMG. Cant forget the bev, never never never.
